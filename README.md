## Welcome to my personal website. âœ¨

## In simple words:
This website uses modern web technologies to load super quickly & even work offline.

## In technical terms:
Using **[GatsbyJs](https://gatsbyjs.org)** the website's react code gets rendered into static HTML & CSS on deploy. If a client visits the page the JavaScript bundle loads asynchronously. The website precaches all links, meaning they'll load instantly.

Aka it's an **offline** enabled **progressive web-app** and works **without javascript**.

You might consider this a tad overengineered for a personal website, but I kinda like it.

It's continuously built + deployed via netlify.
