intro: 'Taking a look at exposure, a new photography platform.'

[Exposure](https://exposure.co/join?source=via-laurajuliette-5766) is an
photography platform, aiming to provide a more meaningful way to tell stories online. Exposure
lets you drag and drop photos into your browser, and then add text in between
them.

Presenting photos as stories is what differentiates
[Exposure](https://exposure.co/join?source=via-laurajuliette-5766) from
traditional platforms like Flickr. Stories feel gently reminiscent of the
analog photo album. Once the standard of photography, its absence in the digital
world left an unfilled void.

Right now, [Exposure](https://exposure.co/join?source=via-laurajuliette-5766) is
mainly a paid service marketed towards professional photographers. But if
[Exposure](https://exposure.co/join?source=via-laurajuliette-5766) can extend
its free service and double down on collaboration & social networking, something
like narratives could become a new standard for sharing photography.

However, having spoken with Luke Beard, cofounder of
[Exposure](https://exposure.co/join?source=via-laurajuliette-5766), it seems
unlikely that they will opt for a more inclusive pricing any time soon. So for
now, you are stuck with either a rather limited trial or paying $5 per month.
This effectively rules out my dream of a collaborative platform, a place to
curate and share photographic memories with friends and family.

> “If history were taught in the form of stories, it would never be forgotten.”

Still, once you have seen narratives, you won’t want to go back to to single
photos on permalink pages. So enjoy here's some them for your enjoyment:
